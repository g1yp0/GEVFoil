# GEVFoil

GEVfoil, or Ground Effect Vehicle (aero)Foil is under development as an open-source set of tools for the analysis of aerofoils (U.S. English: airfoil) in ground effect flights.

##The objectives;

    To create a set of tools to aid in the analysis of aerofoils in ground effect.
    To primarily focus on 2D effects, but not exclude 3D effects where appropriate and relevant.
    To utilise open-source tools as much as possible, for example links into the OpenFOAM CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) project.
    To maintain a blog of the development, and open-source the whole project when it has content enough to be worthy.
